sensing
	- cameras need to see AR tags
		- base
		- 2 corners of the "garden" space
		- trowel
		- watering can
		- plant
	- input = ar tag name
	- output = pose?

planning
	- be given 2 poses, start and goal, figure out the trajectory to move the effector from start to goal
	- start.planner.py

actuation
	- actually moves the arms to the desired pose
	- opens/closes the gripper
	- baxter.py interfaces with all of the baxter's action components 




baxter
	- responsible for moving the arm and other components

gobears
	- main runner
	- issues commands to execute dig, water, etc

planner
	- purely for the purpose of calculating the trajectory from one end effector pose to another

vision
	- used for requesting poses of specific AR tag names




know pose of arm when at base (fixxed height above)
get trowel = 
	- return location/pose of trowel AR tag relative to base (vision)
	- calculate position of hand necessary to pick up trowel (gobears)
	- get the trajectory plan to move hand from current pose to pose above trowel (planning)
	- execute trajectory to move hand from current pose to pose above trowel (actuation)
	- descend and grip (actuation)
		- not sure how to enfore orientation of the gripper to grip a trowel vs grip a cup
	- lift (actuation)
	- caculate position of hand necessary to hover over dig site (vision)
	- get trajectory plan to move hand fcrom current pose to pose above dig site (planning)
